1. As root user: Create user matt with password test

CREATE USER 'matt'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'test';


2. Grant SELECT privilege for salesman table to matt
As matt find all salesman id and name
As matt try to find all customer names from customer table. What happens and why?

GRANT SELECT ON mybusiness.salesman TO 'matt'@'localhost';

mysql> SYSTEM mysql -u matt -p
Enter password: ****

mysql> SELECT salesman_id, name FROM salesman;
+-------------+------------+

mysql> SELECT name FROM customer;
ERROR 1142 (42000): SELECT command denied to user 'matt'@'localhost' for table 'customer'

The Error message is showing because the user 'matt' does not have SELECT rights to the customer table, only to salesman.


3. As root user:
Grant matt SELECT and DELETE privileges to customer and orders
Grant Matt UPDATE privilege to orders table

mysql> GRANT SELECT, DELETE, UPDATE on mybusiness.orders TO 'matt'@'localhost';
mysql> GRANT SELECT, DELETE ON mybusiness.customer TO 'matt'@'localhost';


4. As matt
Find all the customers (all columns) from customer table
Update order whose id is 70008 purch_amount to 5800

mysql> SELECT * FROM customer;

mysql> UPDATE orders
    -> SET purch_amt = 5800
    -> WHERE ord_no = 70008;


5. As root user:
Create user lisa with password tes

mysql> CREATE USER 'lisa'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'test';


6. As root user:
Create a role called staff
Add lisa and matt to staff
Grant SELECT, UPDATE and INSERT privileges to all your database tables
(salesman, customer, orders) to staff role

it seems that I cannot add roles for some reason, therefore I am not sure if I can proceed with the task correctly.

mysql> CREATE ROLE 'staff';
mysql> GRANT SELECT, UPDATE, INSERT ON mybusiness.* TO 'staff';
mysql> GRANT 'staff' TO 'lisa'@'localhost', 'matt'@'localhost';

7. As lisa
Write one SELECT, INSERT and UPDATE SQL command to one of the tables and
check if that works.
Try to delete the row you inserted before. What happens?

For some reason, I cannot access any table as lisa, it seems to be that the Role is added just as a new user instead. 
However, I know that I could not delete the row as lisa, as lisa does not have the delete privileges, and neither does the "staff" role


8. Do the same as in the previous task but as matt. Is there any difference compared to
what you did as lisa?

matt should be able to delete from customers and orders, as we gave matt the specific user privileges earlier.


9. As root user:
drop DELETE privilege from tables customer and orders from Matt. Try out that Matt
cannot delete rows anymore. 

mysql> REVOKE DELETE ON mybusiness.customer FROM 'matt'@'localhost';
mysql> REVOKE DELETE ON mybusiness.orders FROM 'matt'@'localhost';

Deleting as matt does not work anymore.


10. As root user:
Drop user lisa. 

mysql> DROP USER 'lisa'@'localhost';
